## Games List
There are/will be 6 minigames:
-  UA Trivia
-  Guess the Logo
-  Checkers
-  Zippy Hopper
-  Pong
-  Tetris

## Dev Setup
### Qt
Qt runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Therefore you can use any for development (although Linux will be the most accurate, see Target System Information).
-  To install Qt, go to https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer-oss and download the Qt Online Installer for your platform.
-  The installer will require you to sign in with a Qt account
-  Check "I have read and agree to the terms and conditions of using Open Source Qt" and "I'm an individual and do not use Qt for any company"
-  When the installer gets to the screen where it asks you for the installation folder, specify the folder where you want Qt to be installed (or accept the default which is usually your home folder), and then highlight "Custom Installation" and click next
-  On the "Select Components" screen, check "Archive" and then click "Filter"
-  Drop down the "Qt" section and check the following boxes under the newest **stable** (non-beta) version of Qt 6. In this case it is 6.7.2

-  Then find Qt 5.15.2 and check the following boxes under it

-  Then continue through the installer, accepting all agreements

### Project Dependencies
-  Make sure to install all fonts in "projectfonts" folder

## File Setup
The project requires the correct directory structure in order for it to work. There are four folders that must be present in the same folder as the project executable, **gamefiles, menufiles, profanitycheck, and leaderboard**. Copy these from your project folder and paste them into your build folder autogenerated by Qt Creator, which is usually in your project folder ("cob-taylor-games"). Below is a screenshot of the required directory structure.

## Deployment
### Target System Information
This program is meant to run on a PC box connected to one of the touchscreens in the Taylor institute. The touchscreen resolution is **2160x3840 (portrait 4K)** and the box is running **Debian Linux 12**. Note that this is just the environment that the program is intended to run in, but it can run with other resolutions/operating systems for development. 
### Deploying on Target System
Instructions coming soon!
