# Games Branch
This branch is strictly for work on the minigames. Currently we are working on the **Trivia** game. 

## Games List
- UA Trivia
- Guess the Logo
- Checkers
- Zippy Hopper
- Pong
- Tetris

## File Setup
The games require the proper files and file structure present or else they will not work correctly (if at all). All game files are expected to be in a folder called "gamefiles" in the same folder as the project executable. In this directory, the files for each game are in their own subdirectory, named after their respective game (for example: "trivia"). By default, when building from Qt Creator, the project executable will be located in a folder called something like "build-cob-taylor-games-Desktop-Debug", located in the same directory as the project folder "cob-taylor-games" (so, one directory up from inside the project folder). Below is a screenshot of the directory structure.
